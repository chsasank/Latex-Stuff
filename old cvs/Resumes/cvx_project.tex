\title{Financial Applications of Convex Optimization}
\author{Sasank Chilamkurthy, Ashok Vardhan}

\maketitle

We propose to implement the problem of portfolio optimization with transaction costs.
This is discussed in \cite{main}. Authors in \cite{main} discuss various constraints and transaction cost models some of which can make the problem non-convex. In such cases, a convex relaxation is used. 

A survey of financial applications is available in \cite{survey}.
We will implement, experiment and analyse this problem using the data from the real world.
