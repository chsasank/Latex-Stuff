\maketitle

In our project, we propose to implement GrabCut algorithm\cite{main}. This is a segmentation algorithm. 
In this, user selects a rectangle roughly around the required foreground and the algorithm outputs the foreground segmented out very precisely. This works by modelling background and then using it to do a graph cut like segmentation. This algorithm produces visibly better results than many of its competitors like Adobe Photoshop's Magic Wand.
