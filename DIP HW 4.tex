Given: A is a $m \times n$ matrix, $P = A^TA$ and $Q = AA^T$.

\subsection*{Part (a)}
For any $n \times 1$ column vector $y$,
\[y^tPy = y^tA^t Ay = (Ay)^T Ay = \|Ay\|^2 \geq 0 \]
So, P is positive definite.

For any $m \times 1$ column vector $z$,
\[z^tQz = z^tA A^tz = (A^tz)^T A^tz = \|A^tz\|^2 \geq 0 \]
So, Q is positive definite.

Let $\lambda$ be a eigenvalue of $R$, a positive definite matrix with eigenvector $v$, then $Pv = \lambda v$. Premultiply by $v^T$.
\[v^tRv = \lambda v^t v\]
\[\lambda = \frac{v^tRv}{\|v\|^2} \geq 0\]
because $R$ is positive definite. Here both $P$ and $Q$ are positive definite. So, their eigenvalues are all positive.

\subsection*{Part (b)}
Given 
\[Pu = \lambda u\]
\[A^tAu = \lambda u\]
Premultiply by $A$
\[AA^t(Au) = \lambda (Au)\]
\[Q(Au) = \lambda (Au)\]
So, $Au$ is a eigenvector of $Q$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$

Given,
\[Qv = \mu v\]
\[AA^tv = \mu v\]
Premultiply by $A^t$
\[A^t(AA^tv) = \mu (A^Tv)\]
\[P(A^Tv) = \mu (A^tv)\]
So, $A^tu$ is a eigenvector of $P$ with eigenvalue $\mu$. Since $P$ is $n \times n$, $u$ is a $n \times 1$ matrix.
and since $Q$ is $m \times m$, $v$ is a $m \times 1$ matrix.

\subsection*{Part (c)}
Given,
\[Qv_i = \mu v_i\]
\[AA^tv_i = \mu v_i\]

\[Au_i = \frac{AA^tv_i}{\|A^tv_i\|} = \frac{\mu}{\|A^tv_i\|} v_i = \gamma_i v_i \]
where $\gamma_i = \frac{\mu}{\|A^tv_i\|} \geq 0$ because $\mu \geq 0$.

\subsection*{Part (d)}
Given $V = [u_1|u_2|u_3|....|u_n]$.
Then $i,j$ th element of $V^TV = u_i^tu_j = 1$ if $i = j$ and $= 0$ if $i\not=j$.
So, $V^TV = I$ i.e, $V^T = V^{-1}$ as $V$ is a $n \times n $ matrix.

To show $A = U\Gamma V^t$, it is enough to show $AV = U\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a diagonal matrix containing $\gamma_i$'s along diagonals.

We know from part (c),  $Au_i = \gamma v_i$.
\[AV = A[u_1|u_2|u_3|\dots|u_n] = [Au_1|Au_2|Au_3|....|Au_n] \]
\[ = [\gamma_1v_1|\gamma_2v_2|\gamma_3v_3|....|\gamma_nv_n] = [v_1|v_2|v_3|\dots|v_n|]\Gamma = U\Gamma \].
where  $\Gamma$ is a diagonal matrix containing $\gamma_i$'s along diagonals.
