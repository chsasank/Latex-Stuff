\maketitle

We evaluate the performance of Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) for traffic sign recognition using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [3] descriptors. We use German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset available \texttt{\href{http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset}{here}}. Description of data set and overview of results of various learning algorithms used for this benchmark is presented in [1]. Random Forests was shown to one of the best classifiers just behind convolutional neural networks which are very computationally intensive. More details on this implementation is presented in [2].

Different HOG descriptors of test images are supplied along with dataset. We implement LDA on these descriptors as a baseline for performance. We chose Random Forests over others as Random Forests are easy to implement, understand and perform comparably to other state of the art machine learning algorithms.

If time permits, we will do similar classification for faces or human poses.
